<h1>Data Structures Portfolio</h1>

<p>This is the github for my last project in my Data Structures class.  This class was taught entirely in C and was meant to improve our C programming skills and give us an understanding of fundmanetal data structures and how they can be applied.</p>

<p><strong>In the zip files my code can be found in the pq source file</strong>.  The other file present is the assignment description.  I did not do the extra credit for this project as I already had a high A and felt I had an understanding of Djikstra's algorithm already.</p>
